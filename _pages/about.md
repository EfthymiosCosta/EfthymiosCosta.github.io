I am a research postgraduate student based at Imperial College London, currently enrolled in the Statistics and Machine Learning Centre for Doctoral Training ([StatML CDT](https://statml.io/), 2021 Cohort). I am under the academic supervision of Dr [Ioanna Papatsouma](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/i.papatsouma) and Professor [Alastair Young](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/alastair.young).

I was also a visiting student at the University of Bologna, working under the supervision of Professor [Christian Martin Hennig](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/christian.hennig/en) between January 15 - March 15, 2024.
