abstract: "In this paper, we present an information-theoretic method for clustering mixed-type data, that is, data consisting of both continuous and categorical variables. The method is a variant of the Deterministic Information Bottleneck algorithm which optimally compresses the data while retaining relevant information about the underlying structure. We compare the performance of the proposed method to that of three well-established clustering methods (KAMILA, K-Prototypes, and Partitioning Around Medoids with Gower's dissimilarity) on simulated and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach represents a competitive alternative to conventional clustering techniques under specific conditions."  # Abstract
